## Introduction

In this game, the user thinks of a character, and the AI tries to guess who it is by asking a series of questions. The user can only answer with "yes" or "no." If the AI is unable to guess the character, the user can add their character to the database, which will allow the AI to guess it correctly in future games. The game features music from the original game and AI voices to narrate the game.

## Requirements

- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
